									<h3>Testing & Prototyping</h3>
									<p>The prototyping process for this design started by looking at current products on the market like the umbrella hat. Using those products, we started to develop and brainstorm some ideas of new solutions. From there, the prototyping process moved to using household objects, like empty water bottles and paper towel rolls, to create various designs that were then tested by our team and then with the users. After narrowing down on the two options, we then created two higher fidelity prototypes. After testing those by seeing how easy it is for our user to put on, how much movement the umbrella had as the user moved around, and how customizable it is for various users, the design template was set on the three part design. The team moved on to see what materials would be able to do the job while staying cheap and waterproof. </p>

									<h3>Why the Design?</h3>
									<p>The three part design was a great solution for the user because it was discret, compact, customizable, easy to assemble and disassemble, and kept them dry. The two main components the gripper (upper ramp) and the holder (lower tube) allowed for the user to adjust the height of the umbrella as they shift the individual components up and down. Additionally, the separate components allowed for the items to be stored easily in the user's backpack. </p>
									<p>
										The holder gives the sturdiness needed for the bottom of the umbrella so that it is not moving at the fulcrum of the gripper when there are bodily or weather movements. The gripper, allows for the umbrella to stay put in the location at the correct height for the user. The straps allow for the design to be removable and customizable to each user's backpack. Finally, the color of the items can be customized by ordering different color parts or painting over them.

									<h3>Personal Takeaways</h3>
									<p>In this project, I got to work with manufacturing machinery for the first time. I got acquainted with various machinery but for this project, I spent most of my time working on the Bandsaw. Along with learning machinery, I was able to learn about the importance of material analysis during the development stage. I learned how to figure out what kinds of epoxy to use to glue two materials together.</p>
