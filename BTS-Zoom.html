											<li>Problem: Many hosts on Zoom realized that they were losing engagement between participants and also having a hard time gaging small group discussions</li>
											<li>Solution: The BTS control room design allows for the host to get a quick overview of each breakout room without breaking anyone's privacy.</li>
											<li>Users: Hosts of Zoom meetings where engagement and interactions are vital to the meeting.</li>

									<h3>Testing & Prototyping</h3>
									<p>Because of COVID and school policy, this project was completed completely virtually from the prototyping to the testing. As a result, our team used PowerPoint to create the various iterations of the design because it allowed for easy team work. The project started by having various ideas for what could be helpful for the host. A few of those ideas are polls and ‘yes and no’ questions. However, through testing, the users made it clear that they needed more assistance in the breakout rooms because it feels the most unnatural. This led to the various versions of the Behind the Scene breakout room control view. The users made it clear that they would like to not have to enter every room to see how they are doing. And they wish they could communicate both ways with the students. To test our ideas, we had our users use the design in a simulated space where we played the other participants in the Zoom meeting.  </p>

									<h3>Why the Design?</h3>
									<p>The final design allows for the host to see how engaged students are based on volume of the room, number of students muted and by sending a custom check in question. The volume of the room and the number of students muted gives a realistic feeling for the host. This is because at in person meetings, they would be able to see if the conversations have died down or if certain people are leading the conversation. With the check in question, they would be able to see if people have completed the task at hand before deciding if they need to join the group. Another aspect of the design that was appreciated by the users was the easy ‘JOIN’ button that was shown. This reduced the amount of clicks needed to get to a room. Additionally, it made it less confusing because the position of the join button won’t change like it does in the current design. </p>

									<h3>Personal Takeaways</h3>
									<p>Because this project was done fully remotely, it had its own challenges which meant new skills to learn. Through this project, I learned more about how to ask non leading questions during the testing period. Additionally, I learned the importance of non verbal feedback. This was crucial because on Zoom it can create a space where talking feels weird; however, people's faces and movements can show a lot about how they feel. On the line of testing, I had to figure out how to test in an online space where you are not physically with the user. That created challenges that we had to overcome through the way we asked our question or how we set up the virtual testing space. </p>
