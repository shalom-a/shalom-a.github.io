											<li>Problem: Restaurants struggle to get the written information they need from their customers to make their store better.</li>
											<li>Solution: By changing the interface and adding leading questions, we were able to create a more informative app for the restaurants.</li>

									<h3>Testing & Prototyping</h3>
									<p>The first three rounds of testing were based on sketches of the design. The sketches were created in Microsoft One Note. In the initial design, the client thought they would like the idea of having a character guide the user throughout the process. However with more testing, this idea was pushed for a possible future development. We realized we wanted a simpler design that inherently guides the user.</p>
									<p>With the sketched out prototypes, we created a simulation of what interacting with those pages on the computer or smartphone. That simulation was then presented to similar users. Using the information from the three rounds of user testing, we then created a higher fidelity prototype with Figma and did two rounds of testing with that.</p>

									<h3>Why the Design?</h3>
									<p>Based on user testing, people were more likely to write a review if they were prompted to do so or given an incentive. By adding questions based on how they respond with the emojis, the users would write something down even if it is only a few words. The client, restaurant owners and managers, appreciated even simple responses like salty, cold, and too spicy because that allowed them to know what to do better. Additionally, previous users of the app liked the new look as it gives a happier vibe which leads to better experiences with the app.</p>

									<h3>Personal Takeaways</h3>
									<p>In this project, I worked with Figma, an online prototyping system. Figma is a big software that is used in the UI/UX industry. I was able to learn the basics of the software and with that experience was able to use it in later design projects. Another big takeaway for me was learning how to quickly prototype especially in the sketching stages. The company would meet with me about twice in a work week. In the times in between I was expected to have created a revised prototype. This meant I could not focus too much on the details but rather allow users to test the main concepts.</p>
