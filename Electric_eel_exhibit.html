									<span>September 2021 - March 2022 (Ongoing)</span>
									<span><strong>Course: </strong> DSGN 384-Interdisciplinary Product Design Projects</span>

										<span><strong>Project Description</strong></span>
										<ul>
											<li>Problem: Many visitors have a preconceived idea that there will be lightning bolts coming out of the eel. When they do not see that, they leave the exhibit without reading anything about the eel. </li>
											<li>Solution: The design creates a more interactive experience by having people connect their real-life to the change in voltage and seeing the changes through lights</li>
											<li>Users: Visitors at Chicago Shedd Aquarium</li>

									<h3>Testing & Prototyping</h3>
									<p>Throughout the process, the main template for the design was constantly changing. Originally, the idea was to just increase visitor engagement with the exhibit. Then, the client brought the idea to make the focus on eel advancement. However, with the complexity in the ethics of testing, that idea had to be discarded and left for experts. After refocusing the design, the initial idea was to have a physical meter and button for the visitor engagement. But after learning about the confusion in the design during testing, there was a shift to a digital model which had a higher positive user response. </p>
									<p>In order to test the part of the design that is in the eel’s tank, we needed to create our own “electric eel” that we could test. This was necessary because we could not travel to Shedd Aquarium everytime we needed to test. Additionally, we could test safely without too much stress about shocking ourselves or harming the eel. When we started to move towards testing on the eel, we verified that all the materials were safe for the eel and any other living organisms inside the tank. </p>

									<h3>Why the Design?</h3>
									<p>The interactive tablet design allows for the visitors to be attracted to the exhibit since there is more to do than just look at the eel. This interactive design is placed in a location and height that all visitors can use. With the design being on a tablet, integrating more accessibility modes, gives all visitors the chance to learn about the eel. Most importantly, the display of the voltage in relation to everyday items allows for the visitors to grasp the voltage amount.  
									</p>
									<p>The light display will be the main thing to attract visitors to the exhibit because it can be seen from afar. Additionally, it will connect the visitors to the eel as they see the light change brightness and frequency as the eel gets near the visible probes.</p>

									<h3>Personal Takeaways</h3>
									<p>As one of my longest projects, I was able to grow in many ways both in physical skills and in soft skills. As a computer science focused student, I rarely work with electric or circuit related tasks. However, electrical work was a huge part of this project. As a result, I picked up more knowledge about electrical work and skills like soldering. On the other hand, I grew in my leadership skills because I had to lead in situations where I was not as knowledgeable on the topic. This was a crucial skill to grow in because in a management position, it requires leading people who know more about a certain topic than you do.</p>
